Like a sacred flame maintained by dedicated priests, the mitochondria diligently fuels our existence, healing and rejuvenating us from within.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita elucidates, &#8216;For the soul, there is neither birth nor death at any time. He has not come into being, does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing and primaeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.&#8217; This eternal energy, akin to the unwavering force of the mitochondria, remains consistent, guiding our physical form.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ponder upon these reflections:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>The Essence of Life</strong>: Just as the spirit is integral to our being, mitochondria are fundamental for cellular activities, healing wounds, generating energy, and ensuring optimal bodily functions.</li>

<li><strong>Natural Rejuvenators</strong>: The mitochondria hold the profound ability to repair and revitalise. They cleanse the body of toxins, promoting overall well-being and longevity.</li>

<li><strong>Harmonising the Body&#8217;s Rhythms</strong>: Just as we seek balance in our spiritual journey, the mitochondria strive to maintain a harmonious balance of energy within the cells, ensuring a state of homeostasis.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 13, Verse 17):</strong></h2><p>‚Äú‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ø‡§≠‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§ö ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡•á‡§∑‡•Å ‡§µ‡§ø‡§≠‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Æ‡§ø‡§µ ‡§ö ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡§Æ‡•ç | ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§≠‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•É ‡§ö ‡§§‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡•á‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•Å ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•Å ‡§ö ||‚Äù</p><p>Which elucidates:</p><p>&#8220;He is indivisible, yet appears as if divided in beings.

She is the healing balm for every wound, the shelter from every storm, and the beacon that guides us through life&#8217;s mazes.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita, in its vast reservoir of wisdom, extols: &#8216;All beings are born from the womb of prakriti (nature, often likened to a mother); and I am the seed-giving father.&#8217; This reflects the cosmic interplay of divine energies, reminding us of the universal motherly force that continually nurtures and supports.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let&#8217;s deeply reflect on this profound relationship:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Nature&#8217;s Rhythms</strong>: Just as a mother instinctively knows the needs of her child, nature too operates in harmonious rhythms, providing sustenance, healing, and rejuvenation.</li>

<li><strong>Sacred Bond</strong>: The bond between a child and a mother transcends the physical realm. It is a divine connection, an umbilical cord of spiritual energy, which remains unbroken through life&#8217;s tribulations.</li>

<li><strong>Cradle of Healing</strong>: A mother&#8217;s lap, her soothing words, and her gentle touch have the miraculous power to heal the deepest of wounds, both physical and emotional. She is the reservoir of strength in moments of weakness, the solace in times of distress.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 9, Verse 18):</strong></h2><p>‚Äú‡§ó‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§≠‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡•Å‡§É ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Ä ‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡§É ‡§∂‡§∞‡§£‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•Å‡§π‡•É‡§§‡•ç | ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡§µ‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≤‡§Ø‡§É ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§®‡§ø‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ú‡§Æ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç ||‚Äù</p><p>Which means:</p><p>&#8220;I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge, and the most dear friend.

It‚Äôs the gentle art of raising souls with love, understanding, and the wisdom that true contentment is an inside job.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita elucidates: &#8216;In the stillness of the mind, the Self is revealed.&#8217; Parenting through happiness draws from this essence, teaching our children the serenity that comes from self-awareness and inner joy.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let&#8217;s explore this divine dance of raising spirits:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>1.

<li><strong>2. Cultivate Inner Joy</strong>: Teach them early on that happiness is not solely based on external achievements but arises from an inner wellspring of contentment and gratitude.</li>

<li><strong>3. Lead by Example</strong>: Children mirror the world they see.

It is the delicate melody that resonates within when we align with our true essence and the dance of existence.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita offers this reflection: &#8216;Contentment is the wealth of nature. Despite possessing nothing, one who is contented is indeed rich, while the discontented remains impoverished, even amidst great riches.&#8217; This is a testament to the idea that happiness springs from contentment within, not from external acquisitions.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Venture with me on this journey towards self-fulfilment:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Embrace the Present</strong>: The here and now is where life unfolds.

Just as rivers carve canyons and rains bring life to parched lands, water can bring profound healing to our souls.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita, in its vast wisdom, shares: &#8216;Just as waters from different rivers enter the ocean and become one with it, losing their individualities, a wise person, regardless of life&#8217;s circumstances, sees only the divine essence of existence.&#8217; Water teaches us this unity, this oneness with the divine flow.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Venture deeper into these healing waters:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Purification</strong>: Water, in its pristine form, carries away impurities, both physical and spiritual. Regularly immersing oneself, whether in the quietude of a bath or the sacred waters of a river, rejuvenates our energies.</li>

<li><strong>Emotional Release</strong>: Like the ebb and flow of tides, water encourages us to embrace our emotions, to let go of what burdens our hearts, and to welcome fresh currents of joy and clarity.</li>

<li><strong>Connection to the Cosmic</strong>: As we meditate by a serene water body, we synchronise with its tranquil rhythms, allowing us to connect deeper with our own true nature and the universe at large.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 3, Verse 14):</strong></h2><p>‚Äú‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§∏‡§Ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§É | ‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§É ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§É ||‚Äù</p><p>Which imparts:</p><p>&#8220;From food, beings become; from rain, food is produced; from sacrifice arises rain, and sacrifice is born of action.&#8221;</p><p>Like the interconnected dance of rain, food, and life, water healing brings forth an intricate balance in our lives, enriching our existence and elevating our spirit.</p><p>May you immerse in the transformative grace of water and emerge with renewed spirit and clarity.</p><p>Continued blessings‚Ä¶</p><p><strong>Sri Guru Baba Vyas</strong><br>Prana Urja Healing Society</p>]]></content:encoded>

It is the symphony of the universe, the emotions of nature, and the essence of our very soul manifesting in myriad hues.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita proclaims: &#8216;Nature is said to be the cause of all material causes and effects, whereas the living entity is the cause of various sufferings and enjoyments in this world.&#8217; In this wisdom, we unearth the subtle interplay between nature&#8217;s colours and the tapestry of our emotions and experiences.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let&#8217;s delve into this vibrant journey:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Soul&#8217;s Palette</strong>: Every shade we resonate with is a reflection of our inner state. The tranquillity of blue, the passion of red, or the rejuvenation of green &#8211; each colour carries a frequency that can influence our emotions and actions.</li>

<li><strong>Healing Hues</strong>: Ancient civilizations recognized the therapeutic properties of colours. Incorporating specific shades in our surroundings can restore balance, heal, and rejuvenate our spirit.</li>

<li><strong>Universal Language</strong>: Across cultures, colours convey emotions, traditions, and stories. They bridge differences and serve as a universal mode of communication that transcends spoken language.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 7, Verse 8):</strong></h2><p>‚Äú‡§∞‡§∏‡•ã‡§Ω‡§π‡§Æ‡§™‡•ç‡§∏‡•Å ‡§ï‡•å‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§Ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§∂‡§∂‡§ø‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡•ã‡§É | ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§£‡§µ‡§É ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡•á‡§∑‡•Å ‡§∂‡§¨‡•ç‡§¶‡§É ‡§ñ‡•á ‡§™‡•å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡§Ç ‡§®‡•É‡§∑‡•Å ||‚Äù</p><p>Which elucidates:</p><p>&#8220;I am the taste of water, O son of Kunti, the light of the sun and the moon, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether and ability in humans.&#8221;</p><p>May your life be painted with the most divine and uplifting colours, each hue bringing forth growth, wisdom, and boundless joy.</p><p>Continued blessings‚Ä¶</p><p><strong>Sri Guru Baba Vyas</strong><br>Prana Urja Healing Society</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>To the luminous souls journeying through the maze of choices and consequences <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f33a.png" alt="üå∫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />,</strong></p><p>Wilful mistakes, dear seekers, are the shadows cast by our untamed desires and fleeting judgments. They might pull us into the night, but with self-awareness and divine guidance, dawn is never far.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita wisely teaches: &#8216;Just as a fire is covered by smoke and a mirror is obscured by dust, knowledge is covered by desire.&#8217; Understanding this, we recognize the influence of unchecked desires leading to willful mistakes.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Delve deeper into this sacred introspection:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Acknowledge with Humility</strong>: Recognize the error without judgment. Every mistake, intentional or not, carries a lesson. By humbling oneself before it, the journey towards rectification begins.</li>

<li><strong>Seek Inner Counsel</strong>: Before actions manifest externally, they take birth internally. Cultivate an inner dialogue, seeking the wisdom of the higher self. This voice, often drowned by impulsive desires, holds the compass to righteousness.</li>

<li><strong>Divine Repentance</strong>: To err is human, to seek forgiveness is divine. Let genuine remorse transform into positive actions and better choices, illuminating the path ahead.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 4, Verse 36):</strong></h2><p>‚Äú‡§Ö‡§™‡§ø ‡§ö‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡•Å‡§¶‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ã ‡§≠‡§ú‡§§‡•á ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§≠‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç | ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡•Å‡§∞‡•á‡§µ ‡§∏ ‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§É ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ó‡•ç‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§∏‡§ø‡§§‡•ã ‡§π‡§ø ‡§∏‡§É ||‚Äù</p><p>Which deciphers as:</p><p>&#8220;Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if they are engaged in devotional service, they are to be considered righteous, for they have rightly resolved.&#8221;</p><p>May your journey forward be lit by wisdom, discernment, and divine grace, helping you rise above the mire of willful errors.</p><p>Continued blessings‚Ä¶</p><p><strong>Sri Guru Baba Vyas</strong><br>Prana Urja Healing Society</p>]]></content:encoded>
