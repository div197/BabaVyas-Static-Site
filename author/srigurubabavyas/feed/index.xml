It‚Äôs the gentle art of raising souls with love, understanding, and the wisdom that true contentment is an inside job.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita elucidates: &#8216;In the stillness of the mind, the Self is revealed.&#8217; Parenting through happiness draws from this essence, teaching our children the serenity that comes from self-awareness and inner joy.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let&#8217;s explore this divine dance of raising spirits:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>1. Presence Over Presents</strong>: The gift of time, undivided attention, and genuine listening are treasures for a child.

<li><strong>2. Cultivate Inner Joy</strong>: Teach them early on that happiness is not solely based on external achievements but arises from an inner wellspring of contentment and gratitude.</li>

<li><strong>3. Lead by Example</strong>: Children mirror the world they see. Being a beacon of positivity, self-love, and compassion helps them understand and embody these virtues.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 12, Verse 20):</strong></h2><p>‚Äú‡§Ø‡•á ‡§§‡•Å ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡§Æ‡§ø‡§¶‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡§•‡•ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§™‡§æ‡§∏‡§§‡•á | ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§¶‡•ç‡§¶‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§≠‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§Ω‡§§‡•Ä‡§µ ‡§Æ‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§É ||‚Äù</p><p>Which translates to:</p><p>&#8220;Those who follow this divine nectar of righteousness as I have stated, with profound faith considering me as their supreme goal, they are exceedingly dear to me.&#8221;</p><p>May the path of happiness parenting be adorned with moments of laughter, lessons of love, and the infinite joy of witnessing the blossoming of the souls entrusted to your care.</p><p>Continued blessings‚Ä¶<br><strong>Sri Guru Baba Vyas</strong><br>Prana Urja Healing Society</p>]]></content:encoded>

It is the delicate melody that resonates within when we align with our true essence and the dance of existence.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita offers this reflection: &#8216;Contentment is the wealth of nature. Despite possessing nothing, one who is contented is indeed rich, while the discontented remains impoverished, even amidst great riches.&#8217; This is a testament to the idea that happiness springs from contentment within, not from external acquisitions.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Venture with me on this journey towards self-fulfilment:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Embrace the Present</strong>: The here and now is where life unfolds.

<li><strong>Celebrate Small Wonders</strong>: Often, it&#8217;s the subtle wonders &#8211; a bird&#8217;s song, a child&#8217;s laughter, or the rustle of leaves &#8211; that carry the essence of happiness. Bask in these simple joys.</li>

<li><strong>Nurture Inner Peace</strong>: External storms can&#8217;t disturb the one who cultivates a calm and serene inner world.

It possesses the unique ability to rejuvenate, heal, and connect us to the very pulse of life.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita enlightens us: &#8216;From food, all beings are produced; and from rain, food is produced. Rain itself is the sacrifice‚Äôs product, and sacrifice arises out of action.&#8217; This profound revelation teaches us that food is intrinsically linked to the cosmic dance of nature, energy, and divine blessings.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let&#8217;s journey through this sacred realm:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Holistic Nourishment</strong>: Beyond physical sustenance, food nourishes our emotions, intellect, and spirit.

<li><strong>Nature&#8217;s Pharmacy</strong>: The Earth, in her boundless generosity, offers herbs, fruits, and vegetables that have therapeutic properties. Understanding these gifts can lead to profound health transformations.</li>

<li><strong>Sacred Intention</strong>: The intent with which food is prepared and consumed plays a pivotal role. When meals are prepared with love and gratitude, they become a vessel for divine energy.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 17, Verse 8):</strong></h2><p>‚Äú‡§Ü‡§Ø‡•Å‡§É‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§¨‡§≤‡§æ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ó‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡•Å‡§ñ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§§‡§ø‡§µ‡§ø‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ß‡§®‡§æ‡§É | ‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§É ‡§∏‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§ó‡•ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§É ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡§æ ‡§π‡•É‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§É ‡§∏‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§É ||‚Äù</p><p>Which translates to:</p><p>&#8220;Foods that increase life, purify one&#8217;s existence, give strength, health, happiness, and satisfaction, which are juicy, fatty, wholesome, and pleasing to the heart, are dear to those in the mode of goodness.&#8221;</p><p>May you harness the transformative power of food, imbibing its healing essence, and discovering a deeper connection with the divine tapestry of existence.</p><p>Continued blessings‚Ä¶</p><p><strong>Sri Guru Baba Vyas</strong><br>Prana Urja Healing Society</p>]]></content:encoded>

It holds memory, reflects purity, and possesses the power to cleanse, rejuvenate, and transform. Just as rivers carve canyons and rains bring life to parched lands, water can bring profound healing to our souls.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita, in its vast wisdom, shares: &#8216;Just as waters from different rivers enter the ocean and become one with it, losing their individualities, a wise person, regardless of life&#8217;s circumstances, sees only the divine essence of existence.&#8217; Water teaches us this unity, this oneness with the divine flow.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Venture deeper into these healing waters:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Purification</strong>: Water, in its pristine form, carries away impurities, both physical and spiritual. Regularly immersing oneself, whether in the quietude of a bath or the sacred waters of a river, rejuvenates our energies.</li>

<li><strong>Emotional Release</strong>: Like the ebb and flow of tides, water encourages us to embrace our emotions, to let go of what burdens our hearts, and to welcome fresh currents of joy and clarity.</li>

<li><strong>Connection to the Cosmic</strong>: As we meditate by a serene water body, we synchronise with its tranquil rhythms, allowing us to connect deeper with our own true nature and the universe at large.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 3, Verse 14):</strong></h2><p>‚Äú‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§∏‡§Ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§É | ‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§É ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§É ||‚Äù</p><p>Which imparts:</p><p>&#8220;From food, beings become; from rain, food is produced; from sacrifice arises rain, and sacrifice is born of action.&#8221;</p><p>Like the interconnected dance of rain, food, and life, water healing brings forth an intricate balance in our lives, enriching our existence and elevating our spirit.</p><p>May you immerse in the transformative grace of water and emerge with renewed spirit and clarity.</p><p>Continued blessings‚Ä¶</p><p><strong>Sri Guru Baba Vyas</strong><br>Prana Urja Healing Society</p>]]></content:encoded>

<li><strong>Healing Hues</strong>: Ancient civilizations recognized the therapeutic properties of colours. Incorporating specific shades in our surroundings can restore balance, heal, and rejuvenate our spirit.</li>

<li><strong>Universal Language</strong>: Across cultures, colours convey emotions, traditions, and stories.

They might pull us into the night, but with self-awareness and divine guidance, dawn is never far.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita wisely teaches: &#8216;Just as a fire is covered by smoke and a mirror is obscured by dust, knowledge is covered by desire.&#8217; Understanding this, we recognize the influence of unchecked desires leading to willful mistakes.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Delve deeper into this sacred introspection:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Acknowledge with Humility</strong>: Recognize the error without judgment. Every mistake, intentional or not, carries a lesson. By humbling oneself before it, the journey towards rectification begins.</li>

<li><strong>Seek Inner Counsel</strong>: Before actions manifest externally, they take birth internally. Cultivate an inner dialogue, seeking the wisdom of the higher self. This voice, often drowned by impulsive desires, holds the compass to righteousness.</li>

<li><strong>Divine Repentance</strong>: To err is human, to seek forgiveness is divine.

Whatever will happen, will also happen for the good.&#8217;</em> In this wisdom, lies the key to nurturing unshakable confidence.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let&#8217;s delve into this sacred journey:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Embrace Imperfection</strong>: Every flaw, every mistake, is but a stepping stone towards growth.

<li><strong>Cultivate Self-Knowledge</strong>: Dive deep within. Understand your strengths, acknowledge your weaknesses, and kindle the passion that sets your soul aflame. True confidence stems from genuine self-awareness.</li>

<li><strong>Seek Divine Guidance</strong>: In moments of doubt, turn inward and upwards. The cosmic dance has a place for each one of us, a unique rhythm, a distinct tune. Trust in this grand design and your role within it.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 18, Verse 66):</strong></h2><p><em>‚Äú‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡•á‡§ï‡§Ç ‡§∂‡§∞‡§£‡§Ç ‡§µ‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú | ‡§Ö‡§π‡§Ç ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§™‡§æ‡§™‡•á‡§≠‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§Ø‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§∂‡•Å‡§ö‡§É ||‚Äù</em></p><p>Which elucidates:</p><p><em>&#8220;Relinquishing all notions of righteousness, seek refuge in Me alone.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>To the genuine inquirers of inner truths and the vast realm of stillness <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f33a.png" alt="üå∫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />,</strong></p><p>Meditation, cherished souls, is not merely a practice; it&#8217;s a sacred communion with one&#8217;s innermost being. It&#8217;s a question often posed &#8211; does meditation truly aid our journey? The answer lies deep within the serene waters of our own consciousness.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita elucidates: &#8216;With the intellect set in patience, with the mind fastened to the intellect, one gradually becomes established in tranquillity; and being established in tranquillity, one ceases from all sorrows.&#8217; Such tranquillity is the gift of meditation.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reflect upon the profound benefits of this timeless art:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>A Sanctuary Within</strong>: Amidst the whirlwind of existence, meditation offers a sanctuary, a haven of peace where one reconnects with their true essence.</li>

<li><strong>Clarity Amidst Chaos</strong>: By stilling the mind&#8217;s incessant chatter, meditation illuminates the path ahead, providing clarity amidst the fog of confusion.</li>

<li><strong>Emotional Equilibrium</strong>: Meditation fosters a state of emotional equilibrium, where joys are savoured without attachment and challenges are faced with courage and serenity.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Guided by the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 6, Verse 27):</strong></h2><p>‚Äú‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Æ‡§®‡§∏‡§Ç ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§®‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§ø‡§®‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ñ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§Æ‡§Æ‡•ç | ‡§â‡§™‡•à‡§§‡§ø ‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§∞‡§ú‡§∏‡§Ç ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§Æ‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∑‡§Æ‡•ç ||‚Äù</p><p>Which translates to:</p><p>&#8220;The yogi whose mind is peaceful, whose passions are subdued, who is without impurity, and who has reached the high state of supreme well-being, attains Brahmic bliss.&#8221;</p><p>To meditate is to embark on the most intimate journey of self-discovery, to unearth the treasures that reside within. For those who seek, meditation unfailingly illuminates, heals, and elevates.</p><p>Continued blessings‚Ä¶</p><p><strong>Sri Guru Baba Vyas</strong><br>Prana Urja Healing Society</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>To the souls questioning the cosmic dance of fate and free will <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f33a.png" alt="üå∫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />,</strong></p><p>Destiny, dear seekers, is often envisioned as a preordained script, a set path leading us towards our eventual purpose. But herein lies a profound inquiry: Are we mere puppets to this grand narrative, or do we possess the power to redefine our story?</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita expounds: <em>&#8216;We&#8217;re bound by our actions, but we are also the architects of our actions.&#8217;</em> This suggests that while destiny has its design, our choices and intentions actively contribute to its unfolding.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reflect upon destiny&#8217;s intricate weave:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Co-Creation with the Cosmos</strong>: Our life is a harmonious collaboration between predetermined fate and our conscious choices. Every decision, every act, leaves an imprint on the sands of time, gradually shaping our destiny.</li>

<li><strong>Karmic Dance</strong>: While past actions (karma) influence the present circumstances, our current choices sow the seeds for future outcomes. We are, thus, in an eternal dance with destiny, where each step matters.</li>

<li><strong>Power of Intent</strong>: Intent, fueled by purpose and passion, possesses the might to redefine our path. By aligning our actions with pure intentions, we can usher transformative changes in our life journey.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Drawing from the luminous teachings of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 18, Verse 13):</strong></h2><p><em>‚Äú‡§™‡§û‡•ç‡§ö‡•à‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§¨‡§æ‡§π‡•ã ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§£‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§®‡§ø‡§¨‡•ã‡§ß ‡§Æ‡•á | ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ñ‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á ‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§Ø‡•á ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§£‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç ||‚Äù</em></p><p>Which translates to:</p><p><em>&#8220;O mighty-armed Arjuna, understand from Me that there are five causes for the accomplishment of all actions, as described in the analytical study of the elements of action.&#8221;</em></p><p>As you journey forward, may you remember: While the cosmos has its designs, your conscious choices and endeavours play a pivotal role in sculpting the destiny you desire.</p><p>Continued blessings‚Ä¶</p><p><strong>Sri Guru Baba Vyas</strong><br>Prana Urja Healing Society</p>]]></content:encoded>
