Like a sacred flame maintained by dedicated priests, the mitochondria diligently fuels our existence, healing and rejuvenating us from within.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita elucidates, &#8216;For the soul, there is neither birth nor death at any time. He has not come into being, does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing and primaeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.&#8217; This eternal energy, akin to the unwavering force of the mitochondria, remains consistent, guiding our physical form.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ponder upon these reflections:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>The Essence of Life</strong>: Just as the spirit is integral to our being, mitochondria are fundamental for cellular activities, healing wounds, generating energy, and ensuring optimal bodily functions.</li>

<li><strong>Natural Rejuvenators</strong>: The mitochondria hold the profound ability to repair and revitalise. They cleanse the body of toxins, promoting overall well-being and longevity.</li>

<li><strong>Harmonising the Body&#8217;s Rhythms</strong>: Just as we seek balance in our spiritual journey, the mitochondria strive to maintain a harmonious balance of energy within the cells, ensuring a state of homeostasis.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 13, Verse 17):</strong></h2><p>‚Äú‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ø‡§≠‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§ö ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡•á‡§∑‡•Å ‡§µ‡§ø‡§≠‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Æ‡§ø‡§µ ‡§ö ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡§Æ‡•ç | ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§≠‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•É ‡§ö ‡§§‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡•á‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•Å ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•Å ‡§ö ||‚Äù</p><p>Which elucidates:</p><p>&#8220;He is indivisible, yet appears as if divided in beings.

She is the healing balm for every wound, the shelter from every storm, and the beacon that guides us through life&#8217;s mazes.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita, in its vast reservoir of wisdom, extols: &#8216;All beings are born from the womb of prakriti (nature, often likened to a mother); and I am the seed-giving father.&#8217; This reflects the cosmic interplay of divine energies, reminding us of the universal motherly force that continually nurtures and supports.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let&#8217;s deeply reflect on this profound relationship:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Nature&#8217;s Rhythms</strong>: Just as a mother instinctively knows the needs of her child, nature too operates in harmonious rhythms, providing sustenance, healing, and rejuvenation.</li>

<li><strong>Sacred Bond</strong>: The bond between a child and a mother transcends the physical realm. It is a divine connection, an umbilical cord of spiritual energy, which remains unbroken through life&#8217;s tribulations.</li>

<li><strong>Cradle of Healing</strong>: A mother&#8217;s lap, her soothing words, and her gentle touch have the miraculous power to heal the deepest of wounds, both physical and emotional. She is the reservoir of strength in moments of weakness, the solace in times of distress.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 9, Verse 18):</strong></h2><p>‚Äú‡§ó‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§≠‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡•Å‡§É ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Ä ‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡§É ‡§∂‡§∞‡§£‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•Å‡§π‡•É‡§§‡•ç | ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡§µ‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≤‡§Ø‡§É ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§®‡§ø‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ú‡§Æ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç ||‚Äù</p><p>Which means:</p><p>&#8220;I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge, and the most dear friend.

It is not a testament to one&#8217;s worth, but a teacher clothed in lessons of humility, perseverance, and resilience.</p><p><strong>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita elegantly states: </strong><strong><em>&#8216;</em></strong><em>We have control over our actions, but no command over the results of those actions.&#8217;</em> In recognizing this, we understand that while efforts are our domain, outcomes are orchestrated by the cosmos.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wisdom to navigate the labyrinth of failure:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Celebrate Effort</strong>: In every endeavour, honour the dedication, sincerity, and intention you poured into it. Recognize that every step, regardless of its outcome, is a triumph of spirit.</li>

<li><strong>Embrace Growth</strong>: Failure offers invaluable insights. It is an opportunity for reflection, understanding, and growth. By learning from setbacks, we refine our path and approach.</li>

<li><strong>Resilient Spirit</strong>: Each stumble is an invitation to rise with greater vigor and clarity. Let your spirit not be dampened by setbacks but ignited by the promise of new beginnings.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From the treasure trove of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 18, Verse 66):</strong></h2><p><em>‚Äú‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡•á‡§ï‡§Ç ‡§∂‡§∞‡§£‡§Ç ‡§µ‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú | ‡§Ö‡§π‡§Ç ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§™‡§æ‡§™‡•á‡§≠‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§Ø‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§∂‡•Å‡§ö‡§É ||‚Äù</em></p><p>Which translates to:</p><p><em>&#8220;Abandon all paths, all virtues, and surrender exclusively unto me. I will deliver you from all sinful reactions.

Just as these leaves drift without anchor, a distracted mind floats aimlessly amidst the vast oceans of external stimuli.</p><p>The Srimad Bhagavad Gita expounds: <em>&#8216;For one who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one who has failed to do so, the mind will remain the greatest enemy.&#8217;</em> When the mind isn&#8217;t anchored in purpose and awareness, it becomes susceptible to external allurements.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Delve deeper into the roots of distraction:</strong></h2><ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>The Play of the Senses</strong>: Our senses are like five horses drawing the chariot of life. Unrestrained, they can pull us in myriad directions, away from our true path.</li>

<li><strong>Seeking External Validation</strong>: In today&#8217;s interconnected world, many seek validation from outside. This external focus scatters the mind, leading it away from inner equilibrium.</li>

<li><strong>Lack of Purpose</strong>: A mind without a guiding purpose or objective is like a ship without a compass. It becomes vulnerable to the waves of whims and fancies.</li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>To centre the mind and dissolve distraction, the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 6, Verse 26) guides:</strong></h2><p><em>‚Äú‡§Ø‡§§‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§≤‡§§‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§®‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§Ç‡§ö‡§≤‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç | ‡§§‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§§‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§§‡§¶‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§µ ‡§µ‡§∂‡§Ç ‡§®‡§Ø‡•á‡§§‡•ç ||‚Äù</em></p><p>Which translates to:</p><p><em>&#8220;Wherever the restless and unsteady mind wanders, one should bring it back and continually focus it on the Self.&#8221;</em></p><p>In harnessing the mind&#8217;s energy and directing it purposefully, we not only minimise distractions but also realise our highest potential.</p><p>Continued blessings‚Ä¶</p><p><strong>Sri Guru Baba Vyas</strong><br>Prana Urja Healing Society</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction</h3><p>Welcome, dear soul, to the sacred sanctuary where every word penned down is a petal offered at the lotus feet of the Divine. Today, we start our elevating journey through the resplendent verses of &#8220;<strong>Shri Vishnu Stuti.</strong>&#8221; This eternal divine hymn serves as both a celebration and invocation of <strong>God Shri Vishnu</strong>, the <strong>Preserver</strong> in the Divine Trinity. Each verse, a woven garland of Sanskrit syllables, carries the aroma of timeless devotion and infinite wisdom. Let these words not just be read but be absorbed, so they echo in the inner corridors of your heart, where God Shri Vishnu resides.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vishnu Stuti &#8211; Vishnushodashanamani Meaning with Interpretation by Sri Guru Vyas</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading">First Section: Invocation for Removing Obstacles</h3><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><h4 class="wp-block-heading wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio">‡§∂‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§¨‡§∞‡§ß‡§∞‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•Å‡§Ç ‡§∂‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§Ç ‡§ö‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§≠‡•Å‡§ú‡§Æ‡•ç,</h4>

His complexion shines like the moon, embodying tranquility. With four arms, he holds the power to protect us in all directions. His face wears an eternally joyous smile, giving us reassurance. By meditating on this divine form, all obstacles and challenges in life will be erased. This verse sets the tone for beginning any endeavor without hindrances.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Second Section: Attributes of God Shri Vishnu</h3><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><h4 class="wp-block-heading">‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§Ç ‡§≠‡•Å‡§ú‡§ó‡§∂‡§Ø‡§®‡§Ç ‡§™‡§¶‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡§æ‡§≠‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞‡•á‡§∂‡§Ç,</h4>

His form is peaceful, embodying the essence of tranquility that can soothe any troubled heart. He reclines on the serpent Adi Shesha, representing the universe&#8217;s unending cycles of creation and dissolution. His navel blooms a lotus, the eternal source of all creation. As the Lord of lords, he governs the cosmic laws. His expansive form is limitless like the sky. The color of his skin resembles a dark rain cloud, emphasizing the life-giving and sustaining aspects of his divinity.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Third Section: God Shri Vishnu in Daily Life</h3><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><h4 class="wp-block-heading">‡§î‡§∑‡§ß‡•á ‡§ö‡§ø‡§Ç‡§§‡§Ø‡•á ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•Å‡§Æ ‡§≠‡•ã‡§ú‡§®‡•á ‡§ö ‡§ú‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ß‡§®‡§Æ,</h4>

When taking medicine, think of him as the healer. While eating, remember him as the sustainer. At bedtime, see him as the comforter. During marriage, he is the eternal matchmaker. In battle, he&#8217;s our protector. During travel, he&#8217;s the guide. In the face of death, he&#8217;s the eternal soul. And in times of love and unity, he is the embodiment of all relationships.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fourth Section: God Shri Vishnu in Challenges</h3><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><h4 class="wp-block-heading">‡§¶‡•Å‡§É‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§™‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∞ ‡§ó‡•ã‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§Æ ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ï‡§ü‡•á ‡§Æ‡§ß‡•Å‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ß‡§®‡§Æ,</h4>
